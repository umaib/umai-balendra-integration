Purpose: Pigpocket assessment

Hello, I was able to complete the steps until 9 (the various tasks).
I attempted to complete these tasks to the best of my ability given 
that I was occupied with family matters this weekend. I was able to learn 
how to use Postman to send POST requests and got the chance to dig into cloning/
changing the remote url in git while adding the files to my own repo.

For step 9, I updated the JSON, displayed the JSON (could be more meaningful,
currently is just a stringified version), placed my name on the top of the app,
and added a Marquee for my interesting feature (it's an old tag - no longer
used these days).

Feel free to take a look at my postmanProgress.png to see my POST request.
